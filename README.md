# ZTM-Tensorflow-Developer-Certificate
Udemy course here https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery


Overall a great course for anyone interested in AI / ML!

Unfortunately Google has shut down the Tensorflow Certification, I hope they'll create an alternative certification soon.  Although Google has decided to end the certification the information provided in this course is still valuable as it discusses the fundamental theory of AI and the skills are transferable.

Some of my commit messages on here may seem a bit repetitive sorry in advance :)
